esp32cam project making full use of board
I have no interest at this time to use the facial recognition - so I repurpose one of the sliders to turn on off the LED.
Also I noticed these modules run extremely hot - especially when streaming - so I use the internal ADC for temp measurement (highly inaccurate during idle)
But for my purposes ok once it reports a core temperature above 82 degress C.

I found a great tool to decode the HTML script - and I've added three buttons in hopes of recording some timelapse images and playing back from the es32 module.
